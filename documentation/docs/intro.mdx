# Introduction

The multi-purpose camera has multiple functions which can adapt to the user's needs depending on the situation. The whole system will be built using a raspberry pi with a camera and microphone attachment. It will interact with the user by using an android app. It will connect to a smartphone over a bluetooth connection and can send recordings to the cloud if connected to the internet, otherwise it will be saved onto the systemâ€™s memory if possible. 

With three working components (the cloud server, the app, and the raspberry pi), the multi purpose camera is a product that can be used in a variety of ways. It can video record, capture, and livestream and can be used for whatever the user needs it for (ie. baby monitor, car dashcam, door cam, etc.).
