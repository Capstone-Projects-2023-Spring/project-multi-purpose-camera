Version Control Tool: Git Repository

Visual Studio, Android Studio, and PyCharm all support Git version control, which is highly beneficial for code management and teamwork. The Git integration of these IDEs provides an easy-to-use interface for interacting with Git features, allowing us to perform Git commands without the need for complex series of tasks such as resolving merge errors. Code can be shared (commit and push) directly from the IDE, ensuring that the code is protected and shared among the team in a timely manner.
